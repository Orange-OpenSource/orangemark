/*
 * THIS FILE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK
 *
 * More specifically, this file is intended for vendors to implement
 * code needed to integrate testharness.js tests with their own test systems.
 *
 * Typically such integration will attach callbacks when each test is
 * has run, using add_result_callback(callback(test)), or when the whole test file has
 * completed, using add_completion_callback(callback(tests, harness_status)).
 *
 * For more documentation about the callback functions and the
 * parameters they are called with see testharness.js
